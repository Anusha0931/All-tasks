##During my internship, I worked on multiple Java-based projects that demonstrated practical skills in network programming, data processing, API integration, and recommendation algorithms. The tasks included developing applications that interact with users, handle real-time data, and provide meaningful output.

Chat Application (Client-Server)

Developed a multi-client chat system using Java sockets.

Implemented a Chat Server to handle multiple connections simultaneously using multithreading.

Created a Chat Client that allows users to send and receive messages in real time.

Ensured proper broadcasting, join/leave notifications, and graceful disconnection handling.

Weather Client

Built a console-based application to fetch real-time weather data from the wttr.in API.

Used HTTP GET requests and JSON parsing to extract temperature, humidity, and conditions.

Supported dynamic city input via command-line arguments.

Demonstrated exception handling for network errors and invalid responses.

Simple Recommender System

Implemented a collaborative filtering algorithm using cosine similarity to recommend items.

Processed a CSV dataset of user-item ratings and predicted scores for unrated items.

Generated top-N recommendations for a target user based on similarity with other users.

Focused on efficient data structures, file I/O, and stream-based processing.
